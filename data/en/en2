If there is a petition to add Jacob Murphy to the England squad, his Newcastle team-mate Harvey Barnes wants to sign it.

Winger Murphy scored one goal and assisted another as his side thrashed Crystal Palace 5-0 to move up to third in the Premier League on Wednesday night.

The 30-year-old's 19 goal involvements this season are as many as in his past three campaigns combined.

And, over his past five matches, Murphy has netted three goals, four assists and lifted the Carabao Cup.

On Sunday, England manager Thomas Tuchel was watching as uncapped Murphy tore Manchester United apart.

Murphy does have a few England youth caps, but so far the man who was born in Wembley, London has never received a senior England call-up.

"He's playing unbelievable," said Newcastle winger Barnes.

"He's such a character in the changing room and deserves everything he's getting. I'm joining the petition [to get him in the England squad]."
